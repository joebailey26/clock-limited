# Clock Limited Task

## Overview

You will find a basic, styled structure for the Videos section of a fictional site.

An example page has been built and supplied with a placeholder image where the 'Top Read / Top Video' content is to appear.

## Task

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript if needed, build the 'Top Read / Top Video' section of the example page (the right-hand column), using the attached files for reference. The tabs should be interactive and operational with hover states on rollover. Use of JavaScript libraries (such as jQuery) and progressive enhancement through CSS is permitted.
